The Roman Empire, founded in 27 BCE after the fall of the Roman Republic, was one of the most powerful and enduring civilizations in history. It began with Augustus, the adopted heir of Julius Caesar, who established a stable autocratic rule known as the principate, ushering in over two centuries of peace and prosperity known as the Pax Romana.  At its height in 117 CE under Emperor Trajan, the empire spanned from Western Europe to the Middle East, encompassing diverse cultures and territories. The empire was renowned for its advanced engineering, extensive road networks, legal system, and cultural achievements, while also relying on a strong military and a network of provinces governed by imperial officials. Despite periods of stability and growth, internal challenges such as political corruption, reliance on slave labor, and external pressures from "barbarian" invasions eventually led to the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 CE, when the Germanic chieftain Odoacer deposed the last emperor, Romulus Augustulus.  The Eastern Roman Empire, later known as the Byzantine Empire, continued until 1453 CE.
